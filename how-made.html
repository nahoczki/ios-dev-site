            <h2>Pros:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>- Native iOS development allows for the creation of high-performance and visually stunning applications that take full advantage of the hardware and software features of iOS devices.</li>
                <li>- It offers a high level of control over the look and feel of the app, as well as its functionality.</li>
                <li>- Native iOS development typically results in applications that are more reliable and stable compared to alternatives.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cons:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>- Native iOS development requires a relatively steep learning curve, as it involves mastering complex development tools and languages.</li>
                <li>- It can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, as separate codebase and development efforts are needed for each platform (iOS, Android, etc.)</li>
